# return dark current rate in e-/pix/sec as a function of temperature
# based on DESI-3358 slide 9, or else my own dark current measurements once 
# I get access to the relevant engineering data 

# once I get access to the engineering dark frames, would also be good
# to construct *images* of the dark current rate
